// The hook is a temporary fix to set the right icon size for the deb archive.
// The hook only applies to the `deb` target.
// The hook will set the icon size to 512 for all icons with a size of 0.
// The hook can be removed once:
// 1. The proper fix (https://github.com/develar/app-builder/pull/71) is merged.
// 2. New versions of app-builder and app-builder-bin are released.
// 3. A version of electron-builder with the fixed app-builder-bin is released.
// 4. The electron-builder dev dependency is updated.
